//! # QSym²: A Program for Quantum Symbolic Symmetry
//!
//! QSym² is a program for **Q**uantum **Sym**bolic **Sym**metry analysis of
//! quantum-chemical calculations written in Rust with the following capabilities:
//! - on-the-fly generation of symbolic character tables,
//! - analysis of degeneracy and symmetry breaking effects in Abelian and non-Abelian groups,
//! - analysis of symmetry in external magnetic and electric fields,
//! - inclusion of antiunitary symmetry based on corepresentation theory, and
//! - inclusion of double-valued representations and corepresentations via explicit spin rotations
//!
//! for the following targets:
//! - Slater determinants,
//! - molecular orbitals,
//! - electron densities, and
//! - vibrational coordinates.
//!
//! QSym² has been integrated with [QUEST](https://quest.codes/) and its complementary
//! GUI, [QuestView](https://gitlab.com/Bspeake/questview). QSym² can also work with
//! [Q-Chem](https://www.q-chem.com/) HDF5 archive files and
//! [Orca](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/index.php) output files.
//!
//! The main website for QSym² can be found [here](https://qsym2.dev).
//!
//! QSym² is hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/bangconghuynh/qsym2). Please submit
//! an issue there if you've encountered anything that is unclear or that you feel needs improving.
//!
//! This documentation details the public API of the `qsym2` crate.
//!
//! ## Help and support
//!
//! Developmental and programming issues with the crate `qsym2` can be reported on
//! [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/bangconghuynh/qsym2). For scientific enquiries such as how to run
//! the program QSym² for a particular quantum-chemical calculation or how to interpret
//! the results of QSym², please join the dedicated [Slack](https://qsym2.slack.com)
//! workspace using this [invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/qsym2/shared_invite/zt-24thj1y1x-JqvLtEA1xfQ9AylNRCDH9w).
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! To use QSym² in your Rust project, simply add this crate to your project's
//! `Cargo.toml`. The available features defined by this crate are:
//!
//! ### Linear algebra backend
//!
//! There are six features defining six different ways a linear algebra backend can be configured
//! for QSym². These are inherited from the
//! [`ndarray-linalg`](https://docs.rs/ndarray-linalg/latest/ndarray_linalg/) crate. One
//! (and only one) of these must be enabled:
//! - `openblas-static`: Downloads, builds OpenBLAS, and links statically
//! - `openblas-system`: Finds and links existing OpenBLAS in the system
//! - `netlib-static`: Downloads, builds LAPACK, and links statically
//! - `netlib-system`: Finds and links existing LAPACK in the system
//! - `intel-mkl-static`: Finds and links existing static Intel MKL in the system, or downloads and
//! links statically if not found
//! - `intel-mkl-system`: Finds and links existing shared Intel MKL in the system
//!
//! If the `*-static` backends give rise to numerical problems, please try installing the linear
//! algebra backends directly (either via your system's package manager or by compiling from source)
//! and then using the corresponding `*-system` backends.
//!
//! ### Interfaces
//! - `qchem`: Enables Q-Chem's HDF5 archive files to be read in and analysed
//! - `python`: Enables the Python bindings for several core functionalities
//!
//! ### Integrals
//! - `integrals`: Enables the computation of $`n`$-centre overlap integrals and $`n`$-centre
//! overlap integral derivatives within QSym²
//!
//! ### Composite
//! - `standard`: Enables the `openblas-static` and `qchem` features
//! - `full`: Enables the `standard` and `integrals` features
//!
//! ### Developmental
//! - `sandbox`: Enables experimental features that are still being actively developed
//!
//! ## Dependencies
//!
//! The compilation of QSym² requires the following:
//! - Common:
//!   * `libssl-dev` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `openssl-devel` (Rocky/Fedora/RHEL)
//!   * `pkg-config` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `pkgconfig` (Rocky/Fedora/RHEL)
//!
//! - Feature-specific:
//!
