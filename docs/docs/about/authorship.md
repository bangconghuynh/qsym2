## Authors

QSym² (pronounced *q-sym-squared*) has been developed and maintained by Dr [Bang C. Huynh](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5226-4054) at the University of Nottingham, UK since July 2022 with scientific support from Prof. [Andrew M. Wibowo-Teale](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9617-1143) and Dr [Meilani Wibowo-Teale](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2462-3328) and financial support from the ERC grant under the *topDFT* project.

The logo for QSym², which is a stylised stellated octahedron, was designed with artistic support from Mr [Thinh Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thinh-nguyen-a38b7856/).
