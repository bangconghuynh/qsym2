# Magnetic corepresentations

Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a magnetic group that admits a unitary halving subgroup $\mathcal{G}$.
The symmetry characterisation of a linear-space quantity $\mathbfit{w}$ with respect to $\mathcal{M}$ is most properly done using [Wigner's corepresentation theory](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1703905) in which the antiunitarity of the elements in $\mathcal{M} \setminus \mathcal{G}$ is respected.
This is treated in QSymÂ² by an implementation of [the character theory of magnetic groups developed by Newmarch and Golding](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.525423).

A brief summary of this method will be added to this site in the future.
