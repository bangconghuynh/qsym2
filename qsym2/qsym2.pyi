    Python-exposed function to run non-orthogonal configuration interaction using the internal solver and then perform representation symmetry analysis on the resulting real and complex multi-determinantal wavefunctions constructed from group-generated orbits.

    The result is also logged via the `qsym2-output` logger at the `INFO` level.

    If `symmetry_transformation_kind` includes spin transformation, the provided multi-determinantal wavefunctions with spin constraint structure will be augmented to the generalised spin constraint automatically.

    Parameters:

        pyorigins: A list of Python-exposed Slater determinants whose coefficients are of type `float64` or `complex128`. These determinants serve as origins for group-generated orbits which serve as basis states for non-orthogonal configuration interaction to yield multi-determinantal wavefunctions, the symmetry of which will be analysed by this function.

        use_double_group: A boolean indicating if the double group of the prevailing symmetry group is to be used for representation analysis instead.

        use_cayley_table: A boolean indicating if the Cayley table for the group, if available, should be used to speed up the calculation of orbit overlap matrices.

        symmetry_transformation_kind: An enumerated type indicating the type of symmetry transformations to be performed on the origin determinant to generate the orbit. If this contains spin transformation, the multi-determinant will be augmented to generalised spin constraint automatically.

        eigenvalue_comparison_mode: An enumerated type indicating the mode of comparison of orbit overlap eigenvalues with the specified `linear_independence_threshold`.

        sao_h: The optional complex-symmetric atomic-orbital overlap matrix whose elements are of type `float64` or `complex128`. This is required if antiunitary symmetry operations are involved.

        write_character_table: A boolean indicating if the character table of the prevailing symmetry group is to be printed out.

        infinite_order_to_finite: The finite order with which infinite-order generators are to be interpreted to form a finite subgroup of the prevailing infinite group. This finite subgroup will be used for symmetry analysis.
